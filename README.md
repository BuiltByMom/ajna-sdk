# Ajna SDK

A typescript SDK that can be used to create Dapps and keepers in the Ajna ecosystem.

## Setup

- Install/select Node.js 14/16/18 using your preferred package/version manager. Note that CI runs against Node 14, but the linter requires ^16.14 or ^18.
- `yarn install` installs dependencies.
- `yarn build` builds the app at `build`, cleaning the folder first.

## Design

### Exception handling

To improve responsiveness, the SDK may raise an `SdkException` locally if it knows the transaction will not succeed with the current state. The SDK traps reverts to decode and and throw an exception revealing the reason. The SDK does not attempt to handle connectivity errors. As such, the consumer should assume all onchain calls could throw an exception.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Instructions assume basic knowledge of TypeScript, [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5), and interacting with blockchains which use the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

### Working with numeric types

Quantities and prices in Ajna are represented in WAD (18-decimal) precision. Ethers.js v5 models this using `BigNumber`. To convert to and from these scaled values, `toWad` and `fromWad` are provided. Do not explicitly multiply or divide by 10^18.

`toWad` allows conversions from both `number` and `string` values.
`fromWad` converts to `string` values, such that precision is not lost.

Price buckets in Ajna are identified by an integer bucket index, between 1 (highest price) and 7388 (lowest price). To convert to and from bucket indicies, `priceToIndex` and `indexToPrice` functions are provided. The SDK uses `number` type to model bucket indices.

### Examples

Example scripts are provided in the `examples/` directory.

## Development

### Documentation

To build documentation, run `yarn document`. HTML will be generated in the `sdk-api/docs` directory.

### Unit testing

Unit tests run against a dockerized Ajna testnet.
**Addresses and keys in test configuration are publicly known. Do not attempt to use those addresses on a public network!**

`yarn test` runs `jest` tests once.
`yarn test:dev` runs the `jest` tests in watch mode, waiting for file changes.

To pass parameters to `jest`, run using `npx`.

Note that test suites must be `--runInBand` because ganache requests to jump time, mine empty blocks, and reset to a checkpoint will impact unrelated tests. It also enables us to use the same account in multiple suites without worrying about nonce conflicts.

### Maintenance

This package offers a facility to translate ABIs as compiled to a format consumable by Ethers.js. To use:

- Set `AJNA_ABIS` environment var to the location where your compiler has generated the JSON ABI files. This assumes all ABIs reside in a single directory.
- Run `yarn update-abis` to overwrite current ABIs in `src/abis`.

This facility was tested against `brownie` compilation output.

After updating ABIs, run `yarn typechain-abis` to generate typescript wrappers around contracts. Be sure to prettify generated code before committing.

After updating `docker-compose.yml` to point to a new testchain:
- Update Ajna deployment addresses in `tests/test-constants.ts`
- Update token and pool addresses in each test (`tests/*.spec.ts`).


### Publishing

- Authenticate with your npm account using either `npm login` or an [npm token](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-access-tokens).
- Run `yarn publish` to release a new version adhering to [SemVer 2.0](https://semver.org/).
- Commit the updated package.json.
